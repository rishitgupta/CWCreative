      <p>Luna is an advanced 3D gesture recognition system which has been engineered to fit inside the palm of your hand along with a programmable micro-computer with snuggly space left to spare. The actual gesture recognition chip has been miniaturized to the size of a thumb, and can be removed from the prototyping board to be used in the user's custom projects.</p>
      <p>Imagine an invisible button (and so much more) between your thumb and index fingers â€“ you can press it by tapping your fingers together. Imagine grabbing and pulling a virtual slider in thin air, or unlocking a door with a virtual key. These are the kinds of interactions we are developing and imagining.</p>

      <img src="_media/proj.jpg" alt="Project Image" style="float:right;width:357.5px;height:214.5px;margin:5%;">
      <p>The Luna software architecture consists of a generalized gesture recognition pipeline which is hardware agnostic and can work with different types of radar. The pipeline implements several stages of signal abstraction: from the raw radar data to signal transformations, core and abstract machine learning features, detection and tracking, gesture probabilities, and finally UI tools to interpret gesture controls.</p>
      <p>The custom-built Soli chip greatly reduces radar system design complexity and power consumption compared to our initial prototypes. We developed two modulation architectures: a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar and a Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) radar. Both chips integrate the entire radar system into the package, including multiple beamforming antennas that enable 3D tracking and imaging with no moving parts.</p>

      <p>After 48 hours of concept and product development, our team has been able to create a solution which is economical, eco-friendly and easy to incorporate in other projects. We have designed the gesture recognition chip to work with other boards just like any other sensor array.</p>
      <p>The Luna chip can be integrated within wearables, phones, computers, watches, tablets, televisions, gaming consoles and every other mainstream device. Luna has no moving parts, it fits onto a chip and consumes little energy. It is not affected by light conditions and it works through most materials.</p>
      <p>The possibilities are endless. With the Luna chip, you can practically do almost every simple everyday task within the power of your palm. You can unlock or lock a door, you can control the television, you can manage the music system, you can pretty much use your computer. The power resides with you.</p>
